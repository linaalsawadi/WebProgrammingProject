The subject of the project is on the sale of flight tickets. This project has an admin panel and also a login page. After entering the administrator name and password, the administrator can see the ticket and flight management page. And from there, the manager can see the departing and arriving planes and their seats on the plane.

Additionally, a page has been created for customers. On this page, customers have three options: If they are not a member and want to sign up, they log in as a member; If they are already a member, they enter their name and password; Finally, they can purchase the ticket without becoming a member. Once they log in, a page appears asking them to select travel itineraries, dates, and number of passengers.

After choosing the route, you move on to the payment step, which is done using your credit card." And thus, my project ended.
